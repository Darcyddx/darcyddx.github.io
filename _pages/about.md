## About Me <span style="font-weight: normal;">🏄‍♂️ Machine Learning Researcher | Trustworthy & Interpretable AI</span>
I am currently a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) working with Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) on trustworthy LLMs/LVLMs and AI4Healthcare/Biomedicine. Prior to CMU, I was a visiting scholar at the [Australian Research Council Research Hub (ARC)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/farming-productivity) working with [Prof. Yongsheng Gao](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/19112-yongsheng-gao) on interpretable machine learning and computer vision. Previously, I worked at the [TIME Lab](https://time.griffith.edu.au/) at Australian National University (ANU) as a research assistant advised by [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/), where I conducted research on video understanding tasks. I completed my master's degree in Machine Learning at ANU in 2025 and my bachelor's degree in Economics at China Agricultural Univeristy (CAU) and University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver) in 2023.

My research centers on building **reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning frameworks**. My work spans representation learning, graph-based learning, trust-aware domain adaptation, temporal reasoning, and uncertainty-guided kernel methods, video understanding, and LLMs. 

<span style="color:#FF4500;">Research Passion</span>: I am deeply motivated by the question of how we can design AI systems that not only perform well, but also align with human understanding, operate transparently, and remain robust in high-stakes settings.

With an interdisciplinary background bridging economics and machine learning, I bring a unique analytical perspective to my research, enabling me to approach complex AI problems with both quantitative rigor and structural reasoning. I have published multiple first-author papers, including one at Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems **(NeurIPS)**, one at International Conference on Learning Representations **(ICLR)**, one at AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence **(AAAI)**, and two in the Companion Proceedings of The Web Conference **(WWW)**, where I received the **Best Paper Award 🏆**. Beyond publishing, I contribute actively to the academic community as a reviewer for conferences like *ICLR, AAAI, ICME, and AVSS*, and served as a Workshop Coordinator at WWW 2025.

Outside of research, I enjoy basketball, badminton, traveling, and playing guitar. These activities keep me curious, creative, and balanced in both work and life.

I welcome discussions on research problems and am open to collaborations. Feel free to reach out at darcyddx [at] gmail [dot] com.
