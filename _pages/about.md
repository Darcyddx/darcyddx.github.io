I am Xi Ding, a master's student in Machine Learning at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au), with a dedicated focus on Transparent and Interpretable AI. My research primarily centers on advancing explainability in video analysis systems, aiming to bridge the gap between complex machine learning algorithms and human understanding.

My academic journey is fueled by a profound interest in the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning and its practical implications. I strive to address the challenges of creating AI systems that not only perform effectively but also provide meaningful insights into their decision-making processes, fostering trust and accessibility.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the [TIME Lab](https://time.anu.edu.au/), where I actively engage in cutting-edge projects that explore novel approaches to AI transparency. My work contributes to the broader vision of making AI more comprehensible and reliable for real-world applications.
