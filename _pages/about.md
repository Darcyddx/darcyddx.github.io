**Code ⟇ Create ⟇ Chill**  
*From Code to Creation, with a touch of Chill.*

## About Me 🏄‍♂️ 
Xi Ding is currently a Master's student in Computing at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) 🎓. His academic and research interests focus on **machine learning**, particularly emphasizing transparency and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). He is actively involved as a Research Assistant at the [TIME Lab](https://time.anu.edu.au/) ⏳, collaborating with a team of talented researchers to advance AI technologies. Additionally, Xi holds the position of [ARC Hub Scholar](https://science.desi.qld.gov.au/research/capability-directory/research-hub-driving-farming-productivity-disease-prevention) at TIME 💻, hosted at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/).

Xi's research primarily focuses on developing clear and understandable AI systems to "open the black box 📦." He also works on video understanding tasks, such as action recognition—teaching machines to recognize actions like running or playing sports—and video anomaly detection, identifying unusual events in videos. Additionally, Xi investigates machine learning network structures and optimization methods to improve both the performance and clarity of AI systems. Through his research, Xi aims to build AI solutions that are reliable and user-friendly in real-world situations. He has published several high-quality first-author papers, including **two oral presentations** at the Companion Proceedings of The ACM Web Conference (WWW 2025), where he received the **Best Paper Award** 🏆.

Before his studies in computing, Xi completed a Bachelor’s degree in Economics at China Agricultural University and the University of Colorado Denver (2019–2023). His background in economics, with courses in Statistics, Econometrics, and Numerical Analysis, provided him strong analytical skills, which now give him unique insights into tackling problems in machine learning and computer vision.

Xi is deeply involved in academic activities, serving as the Workshop Coordinator for WWW 2025, where he coordinated the 1st International Workshop on Transformative Insights in Multi-faceted Evaluation. He is also a reviewer for notable conferences such as Advanced Visual and Signal-Based Systems (AVSS 2025) and the International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME 2025). These roles allow Xi to connect with researchers worldwide and foster discussions on innovative web and AI technologies.

In addition to his academic work, Xi has led creative projects integrating technology. His Active Vision project (2024–2025) uses machine learning to analyze tennis swings in real-time, helping players instantly improve their technique. Another project, the Image Embedding Explorer (2024), offers an interactive way to visualize complex image data in 3D, making information more accessible and easy to understand. These initiatives showcase Xi’s enthusiasm for developing innovative, user-friendly technological tools.

Outside of research, Xi enjoys sports 🏀, music 🎸, and traveling ✈️. He finds joy in playing basketball and badminton, discovering new cultures through travel, and relaxing with country music, especially playing the guitar. These activities help Xi maintain a balanced, creative, and curious outlook on life.
