## About Me 🏄‍♂️ 
Xi Ding is a researcher in machine learning with a focus on making AI more trustworthy, interpretable, and robust. He completed his master degree (Machine Learning) at the Australian National University (ANU) in 2025 and his Bachelor degree (Economics) at the China Agricultural Univeristy (CAU) and University of Colorado Denver (UCD) in 2023. He is currently a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and a visiting scholar at the [Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Hub](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/farming-productivity) advised by [Prof. Yongsheng Gao](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/19112-yongsheng-gao). Previously, he worked at the [TIME Lab](https://time.griffith.edu.au/) as a research assistant advised by [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/), where he conducted research on video understanding tasks, particularly leveraging vision-language models to improve action recognition and anomaly detection.

Xi’s research centers on building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning frameworks. He works on trust-aware domain adaptation, temporal reasoning, uncertainty-guided kernel methods, and graph-based learning for structured data to better understand how models perceive, represent, and reason about information across modalities such as text, vision, and temporal signals. Broadly, he aims to make modern AI not only accurate but also transparent and robust in real-world environments.

With an interdisciplinary background bridging economics and machine learning, Xi brings a unique analytical perspective to his research, enabling him to approach complex AI problems with both quantitative rigor and structural reasoning. Xi has published multiple first-author papers, including one at Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems **(NeurIPS)**, one at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence **(AAAI)**, and two in the Companion Proceedings of The Web Conference **(WWW)**, where he received the **Best Paper Award 🏆**. Beyond publishing, he contributes actively to the academic community as a reviewer for conferences like ICLR, AAAI, ICME, and AVSS, and served as a Workshop Coordinator at WWW 2025.

Outside of research, Xi enjoys basketball, badminton, traveling, and playing guitar. These activities keep him curious, creative, and balanced in both work and life.
