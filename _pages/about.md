# Welcome to Xi Ding's Personal Website 👋👋👋

## About Me 🏄‍♂️
Hi, I’m **Xi Ding**! I’m currently a **Master’s student in Computing (Machine Learning) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) 🎓**. My work focuses on understanding and improving how machines process videos—things like **recognizing actions 🎬, spotting unusual events 🚨, and combining different types of data 🔄 (like video and text)**. I’m passionate about making **artificial intelligence (AI) 🤖 easier to understand and more reliable for real-world use**. 

Currently, I am a **research assistant at the [TIME Lab](https://time.anu.edu.au/) ⏳**, where I actively engage in **cutting-edge projects** that explore **AI transparency and interpretability**. My work contributes to the broader vision of making AI **more comprehensible and reliable** for real-world applications. 💡

### 🔍 My Research Interests
My work centers on:
- **Action recognition 🏃‍♂️** – Teaching machines to identify actions in videos (e.g., walking, playing sports 🏀).
- **Video anomaly detection 🔎** – Spotting unusual events in footage (e.g., detecting accidents or security threats 🚧).
- **Multimodal learning 🧠** – Combining video, text, and other data to create smarter AI.

I’ve published several **first-author papers**, including **two oral presentations at the Companion Proceedings of The ACM Web Conference (WWW 2025)**. My research aims to **not only improve accuracy but also enhance AI interpretability**—something I believe is crucial for real-world applications.

### 🎓 Academic Background
Before diving into computing, I earned a **Bachelor’s degree in Economics 📊** from **China Agricultural University and the University of Colorado Denver (2019–2023)**. My background in **statistics 📈, econometrics 📉, and numerical analysis 🔢** has given me a unique problem-solving perspective, which I now apply to **machine learning and computer vision challenges**. 

### 🌎 Community Involvement 
Beyond research, I’m passionate about **contributing to the academic community**. I’m currently a **Workshop Coordinator for WWW 2025**, where I’m **organizing the 1st International Workshop on Transformative Insights in Multi-faceted Evaluation**. 

### 💼 Professional Experience
My internships have shaped my **technical and collaborative skills**:
- **Qingdao Aerospace Power Research Institute (2022–2023)**  
  - Worked on the **Digital Twin Project**, building web interfaces and digital models to enhance aerospace simulations.
- **CNMC Trading Co., Ltd (2021)**  
  - Managed **logistics and real-time shipping challenges**, developing quick problem-solving skills.

### 🚀 Hands-on Projects
I love blending **creativity and technology** through real-world projects:
- **Active Vision 🎾 (2024–2025)**  
  - Uses **machine learning to analyze tennis swings in real time 🎥🏸**, providing instant feedback for players.
- **Image Embedding Explorer 🔍📊 (2024)**  
  - An **interactive tool** that visualizes **complex image data in 3D 🏞️**, making AI insights more interpretable.

### 📢 Why AI?  
My journey started with **a deep curiosity 🤔** about how **data and technology can solve real problems**—whether it’s **predicting economic trends 📊** or **teaching machines to “see” and “think” 🧠**. Today, I’m excited to be part of **the fast-evolving field of AI 🚀**, working toward solutions that are **accurate ✅, reliable 🔐, and accessible to everyone 💌**.
