**Code ⟇ Create ⟇ Chill**  
*From Code to Creation, with a touch of Chill.*

## About Me 🏄‍♂️ 
Xi Ding is a researcher in **machine learning** with a focus on making artificial intelligence (AI) more **interpretable, robust, and trustworthy**. He recently completed his Master of Computing degree at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) 🎓, where he specialized in machine learning. He is currently a visiting scholar at the [Australian Research Hub (ARC) Research Hub](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/farming-productivity) hosted at Griffith University, contributing to projects on domain adaptation, temporal reasoning, and uncertainty-aware learning.  

At the [TIME Lab](https://time.anu.edu.au/) ⏳, Xi worked as a Research Assistant, where he applied vision-language models to advance video understanding tasks such as action recognition and anomaly detection. His research focused on helping AI capture long-term patterns, improve interpretability, and provide clearer explanations for its decisions.   

Xi has published multiple first-author papers, including two in the Companion Proceedings of **The Web Conference (WWW) 2025**, where he also received the **Best Paper Award** 🏆. Beyond publishing, he contributes actively to the academic community as a reviewer for conferences like AAAI, ICME, and AVSS, and served as a Workshop Coordinator at WWW 2025.  

In addition to academic work, Xi has built creative projects combining AI and real-world applications. His **Active Vision** project helps tennis players improve their swings with real-time feedback, while his **Image Embedding Explorer** provides interactive 3D visualization of complex image data. These projects reflect his passion for building AI tools that are both innovative and user-friendly.  

Before moving into computing, Xi earned his Bachelor’s degree in **Economics** at China Agricultural University and the University of Colorado Denver. His training in statistics, econometrics, and numerical analysis gave him strong analytical skills and a unique perspective on AI research.  

Outside of research, Xi enjoys **basketball 🏀, badminton, traveling ✈️, and playing guitar 🎸**. These activities keep him curious, creative, and balanced in both work and life.
