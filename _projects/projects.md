### Project 1: Time Lab Research Project [Ongoing]

My work delves into the fascinating field of AI explainability and transparency, where I explore how complex AI models can become more understandable and trustworthy. In a world increasingly shaped by AI-driven decisions, ensuring that these systems are interpretable is both a technical challenge and a moral imperative.

### Project 2: ANU TechLauncher - Active Vision Project [Ongoing]

The [TechLauncher program](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) has the following objectives:
- **Develop analytical algorithms**: Create robust algorithms capable of analyzing the captured motion data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as swing speed, angle, and impact accuracy.
- **Real-time feedback**: Implement a real-time feedback system that provides immediate insights and suggestions to players, enhancing their ability to correct and refine their techniques on the spot.
- **User-friendly interface**: Develop an intuitive interface that allows users to easily interact with the system, view their performance data, and track their progress over time.
